Universal Declaration of Cyborg Rights

DRAFT 0.1. Author: Aral Balkan. Contributors: Laura Kalbag, Alexander Bochmann

We take as given that,
Recital 0.1 

The “recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world” as proclaimed in The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
Recital 0.2 

Human beings in the digital age use digital technologies to extend their minds and thereby their selves,
Recital 0.3 

The relationship of a human being to digital technology is that of an organism to its organs,
Recital 0.4 

The digital organs of a human being can reside both within (implants) and without (explants) their biological borders,

Therefore, we recognise that,
Article 1

Human beings in the digital age are cyborgs; sharded beings. 
Article 2

The boundaries of human beings in the digital age extend beyond their biological boundaries to encompass the greater boundary of their cyborg selves and include the digital organs by which they extend themselves.
Article 3

The articles of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights apply to the definition of human beings in the digital age as defined within this Universal Declaration of Cyborg Rights and protect the integrity and dignity of the cyborg self.
